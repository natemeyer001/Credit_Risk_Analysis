# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Use multiple machine learning algorithms to asses credit risk. Then compare the results and recommend an algorithm to use, if any are acceptable.

## Background Info
The majority of the credit risk data consists of good loans, which makes it an inherently unbalanced dataset, but that can be adjusted for. The first way is to oversample, which selects more instances from the minority class, bad loans, until it is closer (or eqaul) to the majority class. The second approach is to undersample, which selects fewer instances from the majority class until the two classes are balanced. The final approach is a combination of oversampling and undersampling.

## Instructions
For this deliverable, youâ€™ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
